## [Instructions](#instructions)

- The project contains some HTML and CSS styles for the dynamic version of the landing page project.
- This was done by modifying HTML and CSS files, and was primarily a JavaScript file 'app.ja'.

#### • Add linking 'app.ja' to Index.html file.
#### • Build html file and contains 5 content sections. 
#### • Create a global variables for get sections, and create a global variable for get navbar list by ID.
#### • Create a top navigation bar menu function based on "data-nav" a custom attribute for each section. Using iteration ('for of').
#### • Add a function to distinguish between sections in the view. As you navigate across the page, the active section in the view/port closest to the top of the other sections is highlighted, using "getBoundingClientRect".
    • The section will be tested for highlighting.
    • An event will be heard for sections to become active.
    • 'ClassList' methods were used to change the CSS that is displayed. And removing this CSS.

#### - Add the function to scroll to the sections. When the user clicks the navigation element, scroll ing to the appropriate section of the page.
    • Using 'Click' event to listen. (hint: you were just reading it).
    • Using 'preventDefault' event is a default event occurring that when need to stop.
    • Using 'scrollIntoView' is a JavaScript event to scrolling to section.

#### - Add the scroll button to the top of the page that is visible only when the user passes down the fold of the page.
    • Add the button element to the 'index.html'page and give it a ID number.
    • Add the button class to the "CSS" file.
    • Use the 'onscroll' event when the user passes down the fold of the page.
    • Use the 'onclick' event to listen to the onscroll event.
